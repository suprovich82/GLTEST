// Task 3: The Knight
// The Binary Knight fights for every bit of free space on his hard drive. 
// His favorite arsenal is a combination of `ls -la` and `rm -rf` tools. 
// Once, during a glorious three-day fight, he has accidentally removed the `ls` tool. 
// Now he does not know which files are there on his disk and how much space they occupy.
// Help the Binary Knight get back to glorious disk freedom battles soon. 
// Write a program that produces the same output as `ls -la`.

// Note: providing separate support for -l and -a flags is not strictly required but will be appreciated
